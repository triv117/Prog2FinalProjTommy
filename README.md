# Prog2FinalProjTommy
 
Here it is, my program. I think it could have been a lot better, but last week my boss made me work a lot more because school is over.
Also, scenebuilder started getting really laggy, making the UI building experience very time consuming and difficult. Probably because
I really overdid the MainSceneController. I apologize if it's a hassle to correct.
Still, most if not all of the things you asked for in the pdf have been implemented.

What I would have added with more time:
-Fixing error-causing bugs
-Tinkered more with the file system I was experimanting with
-Disabling buttons when certain constraints weren't met
-Refining the UI

Thank you very much for the class. Happy holidays.
